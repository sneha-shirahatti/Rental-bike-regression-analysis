# Rental-bike-regression-analysis


In the era of smart cities and interconnected transportation systems, the effective management of bike-sharing services has become increasingly vital. This machine learning project is designed to address the challenge of predicting the total number of bike rentals based on various features. The dataset comprises hourly data, providing insights into temporal patterns, seasonal variations, weather conditions, and user behavior.
As urban mobility continues to evolve, the ability to accurately forecast bike rental demand is crucial for optimizing fleet management, ensuring adequate infrastructure, and enhancing overall user experience. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this project aims to develop a predictive model that can anticipate the total count of bike rentals, encompassing both registered and non-registered users.
